# `@pkpass/swiftdoc-to-zod`

A library that converts JSON objects definition (as generated by SwiftDoc) to Zod schemas.

> This library has been made for parsing [Apple's Wallet Passes documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/walletpasses/pass), and probably won't work on other pages. That said, contributions are welcome.
